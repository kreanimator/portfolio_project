  pc: `This is my PC. I work mostly in Python and JavaScript these days and using serverless solutions of AWS Services.
    I also like Java and TypeScript. Anyway regardless of the language, I just like programming.
    Furthermore in my spare time I create videogames by using Godot and GDScript, but as an experiment I have projects fully written
    in Java, Python, and JavaScript.

    bookshelf: `Behold my mighty bookshelf, stacked with programming books I ambitiously purchased.
    There's even one in French (oui, je parle francais et hebreu too!). Fun fact: I've read exactly one.
     Anyone else treat tech books like Pokemon cards? Gotta buy 'em all, never read 'em all!`,
